# WeatherGPT backend

One FastAPI service for the **weathergpt** web app and the **WeatherGPT Android** app.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cp .env.example .env        # add keys; everything is optional except what you want to use
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8888
python -m pytest            # offline: every upstream is faked
```

Vercel: project root `backend/`, entry `api/index.py` (`vercel.json` only sets `maxDuration`; do not add a catch-all rewrite, it makes every route 404).

## Data flow

```
request ─► provider chain ─────────────► supplement ─► payload
           IMD ► WeatherNext ► Open-Meteo   (null fields     (nested v2 + flat legacy,
           first fresh answer wins          from Open-Meteo,  field_sources, provenance,
           pinned source: never substituted attributed)       official alerts)
```

| Provider | Supplies | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **IMD** | nearest city station (≤ 50 km; ≤ 150 km when `requested_source=imd`, labelled as distant): official 7-day forecast + "now" from the nearest synop or AWS station within 35 km; district & station warnings, nowcast | `IMD_API_KEY` (bound to the server IP) + `IMD_EMAIL`/`IMD_PASSWORD` (the backend mints 1-hour JWTs itself) |
| **WeatherNext** | hourly 64-member ensemble statistics (mean, p10–p90), 15 days | `WEATHERNEXT_ENABLED=1`, BigQuery table + Google credentials |
| **Open-Meteo** | global baseline; hourly, UV, AQI, sun times; ERA5 archive | nothing |

Official warnings: IMD district warnings/nowcast (when configured) and the key-less NDMA **SACHET** CAP feed,
matched to the point by alert polygon. If no channel answers, `alerts_status` is `unknown` — never "no alerts".

`degraded` is true only for real failures; providers that don't apply (not configured, outside India, no IMD
station nearby) are listed in `fallback_reasons` but don't degrade.

## Endpoints

| Route | Used by |
|---|---|
| `GET /v2/weather` · `GET /weather` | both apps (home) — same payload; unavailable = 200 `status:"unavailable"` / 502 |
| `POST /chat` · `POST /voice` | all clients — `{response, meta, card}`; `card` holds live numbers for the mobile result screen |
| `GET /advisory` | farm action windows (hourly bands, best window, official warnings, optional System One) |
| `GET /historical` · `GET /comparison` | researcher screens (ERA5 yearly series) |
| `GET /v2/alerts` | official warnings for a point |
| `GET /v2/imd` · `GET /v2/imd/{endpoint}` · `GET /v2/imd/nearest` | every IMD gateway API, proxied with server-side keys |
| `GET /v2/weather/series` · `/catalog` · `/health` | researcher + Debug screen |
| `GET /v2/speech/health` · `POST /v2/speech/tts` · `POST /v2/speech/asr` | Bhashini voice |
| `GET /health` · `GET /dev` · `POST /dev/sandbox` · `GET /dev/intent` · `GET /dev/forecast` | web Dev Suite |
| `GET /dev/imd/probe` · `POST /dev/reset` | operators (`X-Admin-Token`) |

### Client secret

When `BACKEND_SECRET` is set, every request must send the same value in `X-Backend-Secret`; anything else gets
401 `{"detail": {"code": "backend_secret_mismatch"}}`. Only `GET /` and `GET /health` (uptime probes) and CORS
preflights are exempt; admin routes need both headers. Unset = no check (local development). The apps read it at
build time from `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_SECRET` (CI: the `BACKEND_SECRET` repository secret). Roll out in this order:
ship app builds that send the secret, then set it on the server — older installs stop connecting at that point.
A value compiled into an app can be extracted from the APK, so this keeps out casual and scripted use, not a
determined attacker; rotate it by releasing new builds and then changing the server value.

### IMD endpoints

`GET /v2/imd` lists the 21 APIs in the IMD account docs (all verified live on 2026-09-28; the cyclone,
radar, lightning, agromet, highway, fishermen, Mausamgram and all-India bulletin APIs in IMD's public
reference answer 404 on the gateway). Raw data at `/v2/imd/{endpoint}` needs `X-Admin-Token` because IMD's
terms prohibit redistribution (`IMD_PUBLIC_PROXY=1` opens it). `GET /dev/imd/probe` tests every endpoint.

Auth: `X-API-KEY` + `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`; JWTs come from `POST /api/oauth/token.php`
`{email, password}` → `{access_token, expires_in: 3600}` and are renewed two minutes before expiry.

**Relay (production on Vercel).** IMD binds the key to one caller IP and Vercel has no fixed egress IP, so
production calls IMD through `relay/imd_relay.py` (repo root) on a host with a fixed, whitelisted IP. The relay
holds `IMD_API_KEY`/`IMD_EMAIL`/`IMD_PASSWORD`, mints JWTs, and forwards `GET /api/v1/<endpoint>` only for callers
sending `X-Relay-Token`. On Vercel set `IMD_BASE_URL=http://<relay host>:<port>/api/v1` and `IMD_RELAY_TOKEN`
(the same secret); no IMD credentials are needed there. The relay is standard-library Python:
`python imd_relay.py`, configured by env vars or a `.env` next to it.

Note the colour scales: `districtwarning` uses 1 = red … 4 = green, `districtnowcast` uses 1 = green … 4 = red.

## Layout

```
weathergpt/
  config.py  http.py  runtime.py  geo.py  app.py
  weather/   models, codes, service (chain), supplement, payloads, summaries, archive, providers/{imd,weathernext,open_meteo}
  imd/       endpoints (registry), client (auth/errors/cache), stations, parse
  alerts/    imd_district, sachet, service
  weathernext/ bigquery, normalize, auth
  farm/      advisory
  ai/        chat (orchestrator), evidence (card/reply/facts), intent, place, agent, tools, typesafe, sanitize
  speech/    bhashini
  api/       routers
```

Rules: missing values are `null`, never 0 (`weather_code` 0 is "clear sky"); all times in payloads are UTC ISO
except daily `date` and `sunrise`/`sunset`, which are location-local.
